# nou2ube

Rewrite of [noutube](https://github.com/dubistkomisch/noutube) using [YouTube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/), built with Ruby on Rails and Ember.

Basically a site which lets you organise the videos your YouTube subscriptions upload. Kind of like the built in "Watch Later" playlist on YouTube, but much nicer to use.
